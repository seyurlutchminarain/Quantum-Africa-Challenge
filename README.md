# Quantum-Africa-Challenge
Notebooks containing problems and solutions to IBM's quantum challenge 2021

Description:
This repository contains python notebooks that utilise IBM's Qiskit Library to solve specific problems using a      quantum approach. The Notebooks are seperated according to their level of difficulty.
Lab 1: Introductory Level
Lab 2: Intermediate Level
Lab 3: Hard Level

Each notebook contains a comprehensive discussion and description of the problems to be solved. As well as containing hyperlinks to additonal resources and external articles relating to IBM's Quantum Lab and the problems at hand.

- Lab 1 contains a crop-yield problem which deals with a Linear Programming Model.
- Lab 2 deals with IBM's Financial Modules and is based around European put options.
- Lab 3 is structured around the field of chemistry, requiring us to build macromolecules and calculate their base state.
